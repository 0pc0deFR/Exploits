== Description ==
Identify WordPress security issues before they become a security problem by keeping a security audit log of what is happening under the hood of your WordPress blog or website or your WordPress Multisite installation. WP Security Audit Log plugin is developed by WordPress Security Consultants and Professionals [WP White Security](http://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-services/) and is the only WordPress monitoring and auditing plugin that works on both WordPress single site installations and [WordPress Multisite](http://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-plugins/wp-security-audit-log-plugin-features-wordpress-multisite/). 

= Keep A WordPress Security Audit Log & Identify WordPress Security Issues =
WP Security Audit Log keeps a log of everything happening on your WordPress blog or website and WordPress multisite network. By using WP Security Audit Log security plugin it is very easy to track suspicious user activity before it becomes a problem or a security issue. A security alert is generated by the plugin when:

* New user is created via registration or by another user
* User changes the role, password or other profile settings of another user
* User on a WordPress multisite network is added or removed from a site 
* User uploads or deletes a file, changes a password or email address
* User installs, activates, deactivates, upgrades or uninstalls a plugin
* User creates a new post, page, category or a custom post type
* User modifies an existing post, page, category or a custom post type
* User adds, moves, modifies or deletes a widget
* User installs or activates a new WordPress theme
* User changes WordPress settings such as permalinks or administrator notification email
* WordPress is updated / upgraded
* Failed login attempts
* and much more...
